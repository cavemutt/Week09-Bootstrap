# Week09-Bootstrap

This assignment was to make a two-page website using Bootstrap and include at least a form and a table made with Bootstrap.

A gitignore file was added prior to pushing that included the node modules, as instructed.

I will not initiate the Github Pages for this project as it needs the node module for Bootstrap installed for the custom variables to work.
